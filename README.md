Nigmafon
========

Raspberry pi based intercom created for [NigmaLabs - hackerspace based in Poznan, Poland](http://nigmalabs.org/).
Main components of this project are tornado (async web ui) and python pjsua bindings (VoIP).

So far what we have:

* working voice calls initiated by physical button press
* simple google authenticated web button for door opening ;)
